## Project Proposal
For my final project I plan to create a 2d grid based rogue-like game that features procedurally generated rooms and
items that the player can pick up for an increase in stats or to solve puzzles. There will be combat involving melee and
possibly ranged weapons. The goal of the game will to be to try and get to the lowest floor possible. If time permits,
extra features such as bosses may be implemented.

Regarding background knowledge, I have developed video games in the past, lending some experience for the overall
design of this final project. I personally want to do this project as it seems like an entertaining application of the
programming abilities we have complied over the course of this class. Furthermore, completing this project with clean
code will benefit me personally as it is something that I will be able to add to a portfolio for future employment or
internships.
