## Project Proposal
For my final project I plan to create a 2d game area game where the player is stuck on a pillar and has to fight enemies
to survive as long as possible. The player is able to attack in 4 directions, and each direction will have a different
attack, adding some challenge to the game in regards to positioning and attacking. Being hit off the edge or hitting
enemies off the edge of the platform will result in an instant death for whoever fell off the platform. The ultimate
goal of the game is to survive as long as possible.

Regarding background knowledge, I have developed video games in the past, lending some experience for the overall
design of this final project. I personally want to do this project as it seems like an entertaining application of the
programming abilities we have complied over the course of this class. Furthermore, completing this project with clean
code will benefit me personally as it is something that I will be able to add to a portfolio for future employment or
internships.
