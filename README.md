## Final Project
This is a 2d game where the objective is to survive as long as possible on the platform.
Falling off will result in an instant death.
Hitting enemies off the platform will also kill them instantly, or you can
attack them enough so that they reach 0 heath.
Depending on the arrow key pressed, a different attack will be executed.
