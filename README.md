## Final Project
This is a 2d game where the objective is to kill as many slimes as possible while staying on the platform.
Falling off will result in an instant death.
Hitting enemies off the platform will also kill them instantly, or you can
attack them enough so that they reach 0 heath.
One attack will be bound to one directional attack at a time, you will get a random attack
in a random direction after using up the current attack.
